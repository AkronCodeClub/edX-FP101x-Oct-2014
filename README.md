[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/AkronCodeClub/edX-FP101x-Oct-2014?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

In October of 2014 the Akron Code Club formed a study group around the [edX](https://www.edx.org/) course
[FP101x "Introduction to Functional Programming"](https://www.edx.org/course/delftx/delftx-fp101x-introduction-functional-2126).
This course was offered through [Delft University of Technology, Netherlands (DelftX)](https://www.edx.org/school/delftx).

This repository was used to share resources used by the study group while working on the course.

## Responsibility

Every member of the Akron Code Club who particpates in this course, and every member of the community who
uses the materials in this repository, is expected to adhere to the [edX honor code](https://www.edx.org/edx-terms-service).
Our goal is to help one another learn and grow as programmers, not undermine the excellent work being done by edX.
